# Info
Basic TWI/I2C example. It's written in polling mode.
pin 0,13 as SCL  
and 0,15 as SDA

âš  If you arent connecting rx pull it up to vcc as otherwise you will be met with break interrupt and hange there.

# How to start
Edit `GNU_INSTALL_ROOT` `GNU_VERSION` and `arm-none-eabi` to match your current needs
after that execute `make` to buid hex file into `build` dir.

# How to program
As I dont plan on spending ~500$ on jlink, clones are flaky and stlink converted to jlink can talk to st devices (why would somebody do that) I didn't have much choice but to use trusty RPi as programmer.
Simply boot and rpios and compile openocd on that bad boy

```
sudo apt automake install wget git autoconf libtool make pkg-config libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev libhidapi-dev libftdi-dev libhidapi-dev telnet
git clone https://github.com/openocd-org/openocd.git
cd openocd/
./bootstrap
sudo apt install libtool #probably some deps i forgot
./configure --enable-sysfsgpio --enable-bcm2835gpio --enable-cmsis-dap
make -j4
sudo make install
```

Now that we have openocd working time to wire.

```
GPIO 11 (pin 23) - SWCLK
GPIO  8 (pin 24) - SWDIO
GPIO 26 (pin 37) - TRST - NRST Didnt used it
GPIO 18 (pin 12) - SRST - NRST Didnt used it
GND - GND
```

# OpenOCD
On raspberry execute

```
/usr/local/bin/openocd -c "bindto 0.0.0.0" -f ./interface/raspberrypi-native.cfg -c "transport select swd" -c "adapter speed 1000" -f ./target/nrf52.cfg
```  

on local machine telnet to programmer. port 4444

# Serial over IP
```
sudo apt install socat
sudo socat file:/dev/ttyAMA0,raw,echo=0,b115200 tcp-l:3016
```

On local machine in vs code install `Serial Monitor (ms-vscode.vscode-serial-monitor)` and add your serial monitor IP

# Things to be mindful of
Sometimes you include source in makefile and it doesnt compile :/ 
Why? NRF added safeguard to prevent excessive flash usage when you import whole lib folder just add `{MODULE}_ENABLED` explained in `nordic_common.h`
